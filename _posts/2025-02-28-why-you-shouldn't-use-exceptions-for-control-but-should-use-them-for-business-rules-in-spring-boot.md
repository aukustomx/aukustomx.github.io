# Introduction
In Java, exceptions are a powerful tool designed to handle unexpected situations. However, using exceptions as a control flow mechanism is considered an antipattern due to performance costs, readability issues, and maintainability concerns.

That said, exceptions are the right tool when dealing with business rule violations in a Spring Boot REST service. In this article, we’ll explore why using exceptions for control flow is bad practice and how you can properly use them in a Spring Boot application.

# Why Using Exceptions for Control Flow Is an Antipattern

### 1. Performance Overhead
   Java’s exception handling involves creating a stack trace and unwinding the call stack, making it much slower than using simple conditional statements. If exceptions are used frequently in regular program logic, this can hurt performance.

### 2. Readability & Maintainability
   Using exceptions as control flow obscures intent, making it harder to understand what the code does. Developers expect exceptions to represent unexpected failures, not routine logic.

### 3. Loss of Intent
   When exceptions are used in place of standard checks, the code loses clarity. It becomes unclear whether an exception is signaling a critical failure or just controlling program flow.
   
# Bad Example: Using Exceptions for Control Flow

Here’s an example of an incorrect use of exceptions to handle an expected scenario:
```java
try {
    // abc is an invalid input for parseInt method
    int value = Integer.parseInt("abc");
    
    System.out.println("Parsed value: " + value);
} catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
    System.out.println("Invalid number format, using default value.");
    
    // Handling normal case via exception
    value = 0;  
}
```

# Why is this bad?

The invalid input is not an exceptional case; it’s just an incorrect user input that should be validated before parsing.
The NumberFormatException should not be part of control flow because it introduces unnecessary overhead.

# Better Alternative (Using Conditional Check Instead of Exception
```java
String input = "abc";
int value;

// Validate input before parsing
if (input.matches("\\d+")) {  
    value = Integer.parseInt(input);
} else {
    System.out.println("Invalid number format, using default value.");
    value = 0;
}
```

* No exceptions are needed for a normal situation
* More readable and efficient

# When Exceptions Are the Right Tool: Business Rule Violations in Spring Boot

When Exceptions Are the Right Tool: Business Rule Violations in Spring Boot

### Example: Business Exceptions in a Spring Boot REST Service
Imagine you’re developing an order processing service. If an order is invalid, you don’t want to continue processing; instead, you should immediately stop and return an appropriate error response.

### 1. Create a Custom Business Exception
```java
public class BusinessException extends RuntimeException {
    private final BusinessResponseCode responseCode;

    public BusinessException(BusinessResponseCode responseCode, String message) {
        super(message);
        this.responseCode = responseCode;
    }

    public BusinessResponseCode getResponseCode() {
        return responseCode;
    }
}
```
This custom exception allows us to encapsulate business-related errors in a structured way.

### 2. Throw the Exception in the Service Layer
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        if (!order.isValid()) {
            throw new BusinessException(BusinessResponseCode.INVALID_ORDER, "Order is not valid");
        }

        // Continue processing order...
    }
}
```

- Short-circuits execution if a business rule is violated <br/>
- No unnecessary try-catch blocks in the service layer <br/>

### 3. Handle the Exception Globally in a Controller Advice
```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(BusinessException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleBusinessException(BusinessException ex) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(ex.getResponseCode(), ex.getMessage());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}
```
- Centralized error handling
- Structured and meaningful HTTP response

# Conclusion
### Avoid using exceptions for control flow because:
- It introduces performance overhead.
- It makes code harder to read and maintain.
- It misuses exceptions for routine logic.

### Use exceptions when dealing with business rule violations in Spring Boot because
- They allow you to stop execution cleanly when an invalid business state is reached.
- They keep service methods clean and focused.
- They enable centralized error handling for meaningful API responses.

By following these principles, you ensure that exceptions serve their intended purpose, keeping your Java applications efficient, maintainable, and robust.
