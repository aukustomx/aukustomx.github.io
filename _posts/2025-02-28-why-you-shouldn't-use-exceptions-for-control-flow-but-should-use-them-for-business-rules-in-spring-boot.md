# Introduction
In Java, exceptions are a powerful tool designed to handle unexpected situations. However, using exceptions as a control flow mechanism is considered an antipattern due to performance costs, readability issues, and maintainability concerns.

That said, exceptions are a right tool when dealing with business rule violations in a Spring Boot REST service. In this article, we’ll explore why using exceptions for control flow is bad practice and how you can properly use them in a Spring Boot application.

# Why using exceptions for control flow is an antipattern

### 1. Performance overhead
   Java’s exception handling involves creating a stack trace and unwinding the call stack, making it much slower than using simple conditional statements. If exceptions are used frequently in regular program logic, this can hurt performance.

### 2. Readability and maintainability
   Using exceptions as control flow obscures intent, making it harder to understand what the code does. Developers expect exceptions to represent unexpected failures, not routine logic.

### 3. Loss of intent
A well-written codebase should clearly express its intent, making it easy for other developers to understand without unexpected surprises. In this case, a simple conditional statement is often more straightforward and readable than using exceptions to control the flow. This aligns with the [Principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment), which advocates for minimizing unexpected behavior in code.
   
# Bad example: Using exceptions for control flow

Here’s an example of an incorrect use of exceptions to handle an expected scenario:
```java
try {
    // abc is an invalid input for parseInt method
    int value = Integer.parseInt("abc");
    
    System.out.println("Parsed value: " + value);
} catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
    System.out.println("Invalid number format, using default value.");
    
    // Handling normal case via exception
    value = 0;  
}
```

# Why is this bad?

The invalid input is not an exceptional case; it’s just an incorrect user input that should be validated before parsing.
The NumberFormatException should not be part of control flow because it introduces unnecessary overhead.

# Better alternative
Using conditional check instead of exception.
```java
String input = "abc";
int value;

// Validate input before parsing
if (input.matches("\\d+")) {  
    value = Integer.parseInt(input);
} else {
    System.out.println("Invalid number format, using default value.");
    value = 0;
}
```

- No exceptions are needed for a normal situation.
- More readable and efficient.

# When exceptions are the right tool: Business rule violations
While exceptions should not be used for regular control flow, they are useful in cases where you need to stop execution due to an invalid business state.

### Right Example: Business exceptions in a Spring Boot REST Service
Imagine you’re developing an order processing service. If an order is invalid, you don’t want to continue processing; instead, you should immediately stop and return an appropriate error response.

### 1. Create a custom business exception
```java
public class BusinessException extends RuntimeException {
    private final BusinessResponseCode responseCode;

    public BusinessException(BusinessResponseCode responseCode, String message) {
        super(message);
        this.responseCode = responseCode;
    }

    public BusinessResponseCode getResponseCode() {
        return responseCode;
    }
}
```
This custom exception allows us to encapsulate business-related errors in a structured way.

### 2. Throw the exception in the service layer
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        if (!order.isValid()) {
            throw new BusinessException(BusinessResponseCode.INVALID_ORDER, "Order is not valid");
        }

        // More processing order code...
    }
}
```

- Short-circuits execution if a business rule is violated.
- No unnecessary try-catch blocks in the service layer.

### 3. Handle the exception globally in a Controller Advice
```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(BusinessException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleBusinessException(BusinessException ex) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(ex.getResponseCode(), ex.getMessage());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
    
    //Other exception handlers...
}
```
- Centralized error handling.
- Structured and meaningful HTTP response for clients.

# Conclusion
### Avoid using exceptions for control flow because:
- It introduces performance overhead.
- It makes code harder to read and maintain.
- It misuses exceptions for routine logic.

### Use exceptions when dealing with business rule violations in Spring Boot because
- They allow you to stop execution cleanly when an invalid business state is reached.
- They keep service methods clean and focused.
- They enable centralized error handling for meaningful API responses.

By following these principles, you ensure that exceptions serve their intended purpose, keeping your Java solutions efficient, maintainable, and robust.
